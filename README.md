#Institutional Intelligence Platform for Technological Universities

This project demonstrates an end-to-end institutional research and business intelligence environment aligned with the TU sector’s Targeted Enhancement Fund (TEF) vision.

The platform integrates HEA aggregate data with synthetic student microdata to deliver governed, self-service analytics, student success risk modelling, and enrolment forecasting. It showcases modern higher-education data architecture, including a curated star schema, certified semantic model, robust data governance framework, and usage analytics to support evidence-based decision-making.
